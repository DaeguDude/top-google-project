This is google-homepage project from The Odin Project The Front End Chapter.
This is my ever first project from The Odin Project, so I'm quite psyched.
I've chosen a difficult version, I'm pretty sure I'll get my ass-kicked but whatever,
there's more to learn isn't it? 
Let's do this! 

Due date: 2020/01/31
